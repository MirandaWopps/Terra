I made this during 2024.2 period in "Programação de Sistemas Reativos" with teacher "Adriano O Branco". This code is a base to deal with sensors receiving radio frequencys on a forest, for example.

It is sending to next node, reading tempeture and sending to a stack the father of the node that is receiving - this phase can have some mistakes. - All at the same time.


higher the delay where reading temperature - like 30s - better. Low delay means less time to everything happens well.
